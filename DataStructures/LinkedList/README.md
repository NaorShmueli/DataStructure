# Linked List 

## Description

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.
It’s basically a collection of nodes which are connected to its next node by a reference. A Node is essentially a class which has two properties: property to hold data and another property to hold a pointer to the next node in the collection. We can structure it as below:

## A linked list will mainly have

 * A property to hold the starting point of the collection: Head
 * A property to hold the end point of the collection: Tail
 * A property to hold the count of number of nodes in the collection: Length or Count
 * Methods to interact with the data within the collection: add, remove, find etc. We will be implementing few more methods as well. Naming of these methods will defer from language to language. But we will focus on understanding the implementation rather than using a standard naming.
